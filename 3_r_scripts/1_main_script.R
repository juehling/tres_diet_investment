# This is the main analysis script for processing the COI data after running through
# AMPtk. Just a few files are saved from AMPtk to use here.

# The files are then used for analyses related to Paige Becker's honors thesis
# on tree swallow parental investment and diet quality.

# tidyverse & plyr for data wrangling
# phyloseq & vegan for community analyses and plotting
# here for file reference by relative paths
# ggpubr for plotting
# igraph for network plots

# Will need to install these libraries first if not yet installed
# To install phyloseq, must install BiocManager and then use the following command: BiocManager::install(c("phyloseq"))
